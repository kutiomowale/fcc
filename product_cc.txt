<@&1209909121520898059>  I could go for some curry. Unfortunately, the only thing I have to eat around here is a pack of functions, so I guess we're currying those!

**Here is your challenge:** Write a function `product` which accepts a number, and returns a function accepting a number. The inner function should return the product of the two numbers.

**Examples:**
```js
const myProduct = product(3);
myProduct(4); // 12
myProduct(7); // 21
```

**You may use any language you'd like to solve this challenge.**
